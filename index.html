            <h1>Welcome to Palm Living Interiors</h1>
            <p>Palm Living Interiors was created in 2020 in Dubai by our two British co-founders Nikki Martin and Karen Dougall. We recognized the need for European minimalistic style furniture, that was high quality yet affordable. With a passion and love for aesthetic lifestyle, interior design and home styling, Palm Living Interiors was born.</p>

                Palm Living Interiors is the brainchild of Nikki Martin and Karen Dougall, two British entrepreneurs with a keen eye for design and a dedication to creating beautiful living spaces. Our journey began in the vibrant city of Dubai in 2020, where we identified a gap in the market for European minimalist style furniture that was both high-quality and affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our vision was to blend the sleek, clean lines of European design with the luxurious yet practical needs of modern homes. We believe that everyone should have access to beautifully designed furniture that doesn't break the bank. This vision led us to establish Palm Living Interiors, where we strive to offer pieces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and durable.
